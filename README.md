# Package-OlleyesConvertArrangePNGtoPDF
 Easiest way to convert 2 png files from Olleyes results, arrange them horizontally (side by side) and save them in 1 pdf file

   Olleyes offers several download options for sharing results: PDF, DICOM, PNG, and the ability to print or email the results. 
  However, there’s a challenge with the PDF, DICOM, and email formats: the results are stacked vertically, making it difficult to analyze them effectively.
 
 To address this, I took the following steps:
 
   1. Downloaded the results in PNG format—I obtained two separate PNG files, one for the right eye (RE) and another for the left eye (LE).
   2. Converted the PNG files to PDF—Next, I transformed these PNG images into PDF format.
   3. Arranged the PDFs side by side—I positioned the RE and LE results next to each other within a single PDF file.
